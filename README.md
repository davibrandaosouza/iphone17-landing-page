# iPhone 17 — React Learning Project

A small React + Vite project that reproduces an iPhone product page UI. This repository was created to learn and practice fundamental React concepts and modern frontend tooling.

## Goals

- Learn core React concepts: components, props, lists, and composition.
- Practice project structure and module imports with Vite.
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling and responsive layout.
- Split shared data into reusable modules.

## What I learned

- Creating and composing React function components.
- Importing/exporting shared data between modules.
- Using Vite for fast dev server and explicit `.js` imports.
- Basic responsive layouts with Tailwind CSS (`flex`, `grid`, breakpoints).

## Tech stack

- React (JSX)
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Node.js / npm
